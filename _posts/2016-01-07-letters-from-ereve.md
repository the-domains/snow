My villagers send me the cutest and funniest letters from time to time. They talk about places they visited, dreams they had, and even the latest gossip from the rumor mill. I'm going to try to record all the letters I receive from now on, sorted by villager personality.

## Cranky

**Secret**

> Hey, Apple,
> 
> When I look at you, I get the feeling I need to work a little harder. Oh, don't tell anybody that I wrote something like that to you! Our secret! Shush and be shushed!
> 
> ---Apollo

**Good-bye**

> To Apple,
> 
> I finally got up the resolve to put this place behind me. You got your good-byes and your how-do-you-dos. Well, that's life! I hope you don't forget about me too quick.
> 
> ---Apollo

**Souvenir**

**Care Package**

> Check it out!
> 
> My grandma totally sent me a care package! Doesn't this look delicious? I'd challenge myself to eat them all, but it's probably better to share. Here you go!
> 
> ---Generously, Kody

**Parade**

**No Reason, Really**

**Cleaning Up**

> 
> Your pal, Kody

**Kody's Visit**

**Kody's House**

> Hey, Apple,

**In Ink**

**Carpet**

**Wallpaper**
